# TCS Stock Trend Analysis using Moving Averages

This project is a simple, beginner-friendly exploration of TCS (Tata Consultancy Services) stock price trends using Python and moving averages. It's part of my learning journey in combining finance with data analysis.

## About the Project

The goal was to understand how short-term and long-term trends behave by calculating and plotting two key indicators:
- 10-day moving average (MA10)
- 50-day moving average (MA50)

These were plotted alongside actual closing prices to get a visual sense of price momentum.

## What I Used

- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- yfinance (for downloading the stock data)

## What I Did

- Collected TCS stock data using yfinance
- Calculated MA10 and MA50 from the closing prices
- Plotted all three lines (Close, MA10, MA50) on a single chart
- Saved the chart for use in reports and presentations

## Sample Output

Here's the output chart generated from the project:

## What's Next

In future versions, I plan to:
- Add more technical indicators like RSI or MACD
- Build a basic machine learning model to predict future price movement
- Improve feature engineering for better accuracy
